# rugmi
An imgur clone I'm making to showcase my programming skills.

## Uses
* Django
* Pillow for images
* A database engine of your choice. SQLite is included by default.

# Quick Preview

This is for when you want to quickly preview rugmi's functionality. Remember
that when deploying to a production environment you should consult django's
deployment docs.

Remember that Django and Pillow have to be installed!
```bash
# pip install Django Pillow 
```

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/aJns/rugmi.git
$ cd rugmi

$ python manage.py runserver
```

Then you can access rugmi at [](localhost:8000/images)
